                    THE MATRIX - "pillScene"
                        MORPHEUS
                        Let me tell you why you are here.
                        You have come because you know
                        something. What you know you
                        can't explain but you feel it.
                        You've felt it your whole life,
                        felt that something is wrong with
                        the world. You don't know what,
                        but it's there like a splinter in
                        your mind, driving you mad. It is
                        this feeling that brought you to
                        me. Do you know what I'm talking
                        about?
                        
                        NEO
                        The Matrix?
        
                        MORPHEUS
                        Do you want to know what it is?
                        Neo swallows hard and nods.
        
                        MORPHEUS
                        The Matrix is everywhere, it's all
                        around us, here even in this room.
                        You can see it out your window or
                        on your television. You feel it
                        when you go to work, or go to
                        church or pay your taxes. It is
                        the world that has been pulled
                        over your eyes to blind you from
                        the truth.
                        
                        NEO
                        What truth?
                        
                        MORPHEUS
                        That you are a slave, Neo. Like
                        everyone else, you were born into
                        bondage, kept inside a prison that
                        you cannot smell, taste, or touch.
                        A prison for your mind.
        
                        MORPHEUS
                        Unfortunately, no one can be told
                        what the Matrix is. You have to
                        see it for yourself.
        
             Morpheus opens his hands. In the right is a red pill.
            In the left, a blue pill.
        
                        MORPHEUS
                        This is your last chance. After
                        this, there is no going back. You
                        take the blue pill and the story
                        ends. You wake in your bed and
                        you believe whatever you want to
                        believe.
                        
            The pills in his open hands are reflected in the glasses.
        
                        MORPHEUS
                        You take the red pill and you stay
                        in Wonderland and I show you how
                        deep the rabbit-hole goes.
        
            Neo feels the smooth skin of the capsules, the moisture
            growing in his palms.
        
                        MORPHEUS
                        Remember that all I am offering is
                        the truth. Nothing more.
